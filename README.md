# facebook-contact-qr-generator
This is a GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey script to generate scannable vCards from Facebook friends' contact info.

It works by reading information off your friends' "About" page, -- assembling that contact information into a vCard and rendering it as a QR code in place of their profile picture.  This allows you to easily scan it into your phone with Google Goggles.

To my knowledge, this is not in violation of any terms of service; [the best option that I could find](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/26/the-address-book-wars-continue-facebook-contact-scraping-chrome-extension-taken-down/) had suffered this fate earlier.
